# Mask Detection AI Model

## Description

This project implements an AI model for mask detection in images. 
The model can predict whether a person in an image is wearing a mask or not.

## Features

- Detects the presence of masks in images.
- Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.
- Includes data augmentation and normalization for improved performance.

## Dataset

The Kaggle dataset consists of images containing people with and without masks. 
The "with_mask" and "without_mask" directories contain the labeled images.
The dataset was preprocessed and split into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Colab
- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow 2.x
